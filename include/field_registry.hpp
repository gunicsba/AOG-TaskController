/**
 * @file field_registry.hpp
 * @brief Persistent field-name -> field-index mapping, used to make ISOBUS TRACK's
 * DDI 508 (Unique Guidance Reference Line ID) actually unique across fields.
 *
 * AOG's own PGN 0xF4 guidance reference ID is only a 16-bit value scoped to whatever
 * field is currently open in AOG - it is not guaranteed unique across different fields.
 * An implement that caches per-track state (e.g. an offset) keyed on DDI 508 alone can
 * therefore collide across a field switch. This registry assigns each field name a
 * stable index, which the caller folds into the upper 16 bits of the 32-bit DDI 508
 * value (see Application's PGN 0xF3/0xF4 handling), leaving AOG's own 16-bit ID in the
 * lower 16 bits untouched.
