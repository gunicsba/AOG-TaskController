# AOG-TaskController — Protocol Reference

This document describes the interfaces AOG-TaskController exposes to the rest of the system. The intended audience is anyone writing a client — AgOpenGPS (AgIO), AgValoniaGPS, or a generic ISOBUS controller — that needs to talk to the TC.

For Linux deployment of the TC itself (systemd, CAN setup, the daemon footprint), see [LINUX_DAEMON.md](LINUX_DAEMON.md). For the TC's threading model — which callbacks run on which thread, and what that means for any state you touch — see [CONCURRENCY.md](CONCURRENCY.md).

## 1. Overview

AOG-TaskController sits between two worlds:

```
   AgIO / AgValonia                 ISOBUS bus (CAN @ 250 kbps)
       (LAN/UDP)                    (sprayers, planters, TECU)
            │                                  │
            ▼                                  ▼
    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │           AOG-TaskController                  │
    │                                               │
    │  • UDP framing on subnet:8888 / .255:9999     │
    │  • ISO 11783 TaskController (Section Control) │
    │  • Optional ISO 11783-9 Tractor ECU (TECU)    │
    └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Three things to understand before reading the rest:

1. **All client traffic is UDP.** The TC speaks an AgIO-style framed UDP protocol on the LAN. There is no TCP, REST, or gRPC interface.
2. **The TC is the AgIO/AgValonia *peer*, not its client.** AgIO/AgValonia opens its sockets; the TC also opens its sockets; they exchange framed packets. Either can come up first.
3. **ISO 11783 is the source of truth for the CAN side.** The TC implements the ISOBUS Task Controller (Section Control, Generation 1, ISO 11783-10) using the [AgIsoStack++](https://github.com/Open-Agriculture/AgIsoStack-plus-plus) library. You do not need to know ISOBUS to *talk to the TC* — only to understand what it does on the bus.

## 2. UDP wire protocol

### 2.1 Packet framing

Every packet — both directions — uses the same frame:

```
 Offset  Size  Field        Notes
 0       2     Start         0x80 0x81 (big-endian sentinel)
 2       1     Source        Sender's logical address (see 2.2)
 3       1     PGN           Logical message id (see 2.5/2.6)
 4       1     Length        Number of payload bytes (N)
 5       N     Payload       N bytes, depends on PGN
 5+N     1     Checksum      Sum of bytes [Source .. last payload byte], mod 256
```

Total wire size is `N + 6` bytes. The maximum payload is currently 250 bytes (limited by the TC's 512-byte receive buffer; in practice the largest PGN in use is 8 bytes).

**Checksum**: the TC currently does **not** validate inbound checksums (the verification code is present but commented out in `udp_connections.cpp`). Clients **should still compute and include a correct checksum** so that future TC versions, or third-party listeners, can validate.

### 2.2 Source addresses

Source byte identifies the logical sender of a frame. The conventions used today:

| Source | Logical sender |
|---|---|
| `0x7F` (127) | **AgIO / AgValonia** (the GUI/host application) |
| `0x80` (128) | **AOG-TaskController** itself |

Other addresses appear on the ISOBUS side but are not used in UDP frames.

### 2.3 Ports and binding

The TC opens two UDP sockets:

| Socket | Bind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Main | `<LAN-IP>:8888` | All operational traffic to/from AgIO/AgValonia |
| Address detection | `0.0.0.0:8888` | Listens for the subnet-detection PGN so AgIO can tell the TC what subnet to use |

Both sockets have `SO_REUSEADDR` set (needed on Linux so the same port can host the specific-IP bind and the wildcard bind simultaneously).

The TC sends to **`<subnet>.255:9999`** as a broadcast. The "subnet" is configured via `settings.json` and can be overridden at runtime by the subnet-detection PGN.

### 2.4 NIC selection

On startup the TC enumerates network interfaces and picks the first IPv4 address whose first three octets match `settings.subnet`:

- **Linux/macOS**: via `getifaddrs(3)`.
- **Windows**: via the hostname-based Boost.Asio resolver.

If no NIC matches, the TC falls back to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) — useful for local testing but means broadcast to LAN won't work.

### 2.5 PGNs inbound (client → TC)

All PGNs sent **by AgIO/AgValonia to the TC** use source `0x7F`.

| PGN | Name | Length | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0xC9` (201) | Subnet detection | 5 | `[0xC9, 0xC9, IP0, IP1, IP2]` |
| `0xE5` (229) | Section states (64 sections) | 8 | Bitfield: bit `8·j + i` of byte `j` is section `(8j + i)` ON/OFF |
| `0xF1` (241) | Section control mode | 1 | `[mode]` where `1` = enabled, `0` = disabled |
| `0xF2` (242) | Process data | 6 | `[DDI_lo, DDI_hi, val0, val1, val2, val3]` — DDI is little-endian `uint16`; value is little-endian `int32` |

#### `0xC9` — Subnet detection

Tells the TC which `/24` subnet AgIO/AgValonia lives on. The first two payload bytes are `0xC9 0xC9` (a magic to disambiguate from other PGNs that share the source). The next three bytes are the first three octets of AgIO's IP.

On receipt the TC sets `settings.subnet = [IP0, IP1, IP2]`, closes the main socket, re-runs NIC enumeration, and rebinds. Useful for plug-and-play scenarios where the host may move between subnets.

#### `0xE5` — Section states

Reports the *actual* state of up to 64 sections. 8 bytes = 64 bits, one bit per section. The TC forwards these to the connected ISOBUS implement via the appropriate condensed work-state DDIs (DDI 160/161/290).

#### `0xF1` — Section control mode

`1` = automatic (TC drives the implement). `0` = manual (operator drives). The TC logs and propagates this to the implement.

#### `0xF2` — Process data

Wraps a single ISO 11783 DDI/value pair. The TC currently dispatches on these DDIs:

| DDI (decimal) | Name | TC behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `156` | Actual speed (mm/s) | Stored. If TECU enabled, broadcast as Ground/Wheel/Machine-selected speed (PGN 65256) + NMEA2000 SOG. Drives forward/reverse direction. Also produces J1939 PGN 65256 every 100 ms. |
| `597` | Total distance (mm) | Stored and displayed on the VT Status page. If TECU is enabled, also populated into Speed Messages distance fields. |
| Guidance line deviation | XTE (mm) | Converted to metres. Broadcast as NMEA2000 XTE (PGN 0x1F903) at 1 Hz. |

Unknown DDIs are silently ignored (PGN 0xF2 is the generic process-data channel — the TC will gain more DDIs over time).

### 2.6 PGNs outbound (TC → client)

All PGNs sent **by the TC to AgIO/AgValonia** use source `0x80`.

| PGN | Name | Length | Frequency | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0xDD` (221) | Hardware message | 2 + T | On event | `[duration, colour, text0, text1, ...]` — `T` = UTF-8 text bytes |
| `0xF0` (240) | Section heartbeat / state | 2 + ⌈N/8⌉ | 100 ms | `[mode, num_sections, byte0, byte1, ...]` |

#### `0xDD` — Hardware message

Displays a text banner across the top of the AgOpenGPS map so the operator can see TC state that would otherwise only reach the console log. Payload:

- byte 0: `duration` — see the caveat below
- byte 1: `colour` — `0` renders a Salmon background (alert), any other value renders Bisque (info). The TC sends `1` for info.
- bytes 2..: the message text, UTF-8, **not** NUL-terminated

The frame's `Length` field is therefore `text_bytes + 2`, and AOG reads exactly `Length - 2` bytes starting at wire offset 7. The TC caps text at 60 bytes and truncates on a UTF-8 character boundary — splitting a multi-byte sequence would render as U+FFFD, and the display label clips long text anyway.

**`duration` is frames, not seconds.** AOG stores `duration × 10` into a counter that it decrements once per OpenGL render tick, so the banner lasts `duration × 10` redraws — roughly `duration` seconds at AOG's nominal 10 Hz, but it stretches or shrinks with frame rate. **A condition that persists must be re-sent**; do not send once with a large duration and expect the banner to hold. The operator can also dismiss a banner early by clicking it.

**AgOpenGPS ignores the source byte for this PGN** — it dispatches on the PGN byte alone. The TC still sends `0x80` per §2.2.

**Display is opt-in on the AOG side.** AgOpenGPS drops these frames unless *Config → Data → Hardware Messages* is enabled; the setting defaults to **off**. A correct implementation looks like a no-op until it is switched on, which is the first thing to check when testing. There is no corresponding TC-side setting — the TC always sends.

Messages the TC currently emits:

| Text | Colour | Duration | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Implement: <name> (<n> sections, <w> m)` | Info | 5 | An implement with sections registers. The `, <w> m` clause is omitted when the DDOP has no usable geometry. |
| `Implement lost: <name>` | Alert | 10 | A previously seen implement disappears from the client list. |
| `TC address conflict: preferred address in use` | Alert | 20 | Another control function claiming `NAME::Function::TaskController` holds address `0xF7`. Re-sent every 15 s while true. |
| `TC address conflict resolved` | Info | 5 | The above clears. |
| `TECU failed to claim address 240` | Alert | 10 | Once at startup, when the TECU is enabled but could not claim its fixed address. |

The conflict messages surface on the operator's screen what the TC already writes to its console log; the console warning remains and keeps its own 30 s throttle.

#### `0xF0` — Section heartbeat / state

Sent every 100 ms for each connected ISOBUS implement that has sections. The payload is:

- byte 0: `1` if section control is enabled (auto), `0` if disabled (manual)
- byte 1: `num_sections` (the implement's section count)
- bytes 2..: bitfield of *actual* section ON/OFF states (1 bit per section, LSB-first within each byte)

If no implement is currently connected (or none have sections), and `aogHeartbeatEnabled` is `true` in `settings.json`, the TC still sends `0xF0` with `num_sections = 0` and no bitfield — a pure "I'm alive" beacon so AgIO can light up its ISOBUS indicator.

> **Compatibility note:** AgOpenGPS releases **before v6.8.2 beta 5** do not handle the `num_sections = 0` heartbeat correctly. Set `aogHeartbeatEnabled: false` in `settings.json` if pairing with an older AOG. AgValonia and AOG ≥ v6.8.2 beta 5 are fine.

---

## 3. Settings reference

The TC reads `settings.json` from a per-user config directory:

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\AOG-TaskController\settings.json` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/AOG-TaskController/settings.json` (or `~/.config/AOG-TaskController/settings.json` if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset) |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/AOG-TaskController/settings.json` |

```json
{
    "subnet": [192, 168, 5],
    "tecuEnabled": true,
    "nmeaSendEnabled": true,
    "aogHeartbeatEnabled": true,
    "vtEnabled": true,
    "tcVersion": 3,
    "languageCode": "en",
    "countryCode": "US"
}
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `subnet` | `int[3]` | `[192, 168, 5]` | First three octets of the LAN AgIO/AgValonia lives on. Used for NIC selection and broadcast destination. |
| `tecuEnabled` | `bool` | `true` | If `true`, the TC also impersonates a Tractor ECU on the CAN bus (claims address 240, broadcasts Speed Messages/NMEA2000, announces Class 1 BasicTractorECUServer). Set `false` when the tractor already has a TECU. |
| `nmeaSendEnabled` | `bool` | `true` | Enable cyclic NMEA2000 COG/SOG transmission. Requires `tecuEnabled`; the VT disables this control when no TECU interface exists. |
| `aogHeartbeatEnabled` | `bool` | `true` | Send `0xF0` heartbeat to AgIO/AgValonia every 100 ms even with no implement. Disable for AOG < v6.8.2 beta 5. |
| `vtEnabled` | `bool` | `true` | Register the Virtual Terminal client and display the TC UI when a VT is present. |
| `tcVersion` | `integer` | `3` | Task Controller version code (`0`=DIS, `1`=FDIS.1, `2`=First Edition, `3`=Second Edition Draft, `4`=Second Published Edition). |
| `languageCode` | `string` | `"en"` | Two-character language code advertised through the ISOBUS language interface. |
| `countryCode` | `string` | `"US"` | Two-character country code advertised through the ISOBUS language interface. |

Unknown keys are ignored. Settings updates are written to a temporary file and atomically renamed over `settings.json`; the previous file is preserved if writing fails.

---

## 4. Command-line reference

```
AOG-TaskController [options]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--help` | — | Print usage and exit. |
| `--version` | — | Print git-describe version (with `-dirty` suffix on a dirty tree) and exit. |
| `--can_adapter=<name>` | none | CAN driver. One of: `peak-pcan`, `innomaker-usb2can`, `rusoku-toucan`, `sys-tec-usb2can` (all Windows), `socketcan` (Linux). **Required** — the TC will not start without a driver. |
| `--can_channel=<id>` | — | Driver-specific channel. Numeric (`1`, `2`, ...) for Windows USB adapters; interface name (`can0`, `vcan0`) for SocketCAN. |
| `--log_level=<lvl>` | — | One of `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`. Filters AgIsoStack log output. |
| `--log2file` | off | Also write all output to `<config>/logs/AOG-TaskController_YYYY-M-D_H-M.log`. |

## 5. ISOBUS / CAN side overview

This section is for context. The TC implements the bus side according to ISO 11783 — that standard, plus the AgIsoStack documentation, is the authoritative reference.

### 5.1 What the TC presents on the bus

Two control functions, both claiming addresses via standard J1939-81 address claim (with the 250 ms post-claim quiet period enforced):

| CF | NAME function | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task Controller | `TaskController` (function code 61) | Preferred `247` (ISO 11783-10 MappingComputer). Walks if claimed. | Always present. |
| Tractor ECU | `TractorECU` (function code 132) | Fixed `240` (non-arbitrary-address-capable per ISO 11783-9). | Only present if `tecuEnabled: true`. |

Common NAME fields: Industry Group `2` (Agricultural), Device Class `0`, Manufacturer Code `1407`, Identity `20`. Override these in `app.cpp` if you fork.

### 5.2 What the TC sends on the bus

| PGN | Cadence | Producer | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0xCB00` (Process Data) | 2 s | TC | ISO 11783-10 B.8.1 Task Controller Status. Status byte bit 1 = task totals active. |
| `0x1F903` (NMEA2000 XTE) | 1 Hz | TC | Cross-track error, derived from AOG's guidance-line deviation PGN. |
| `0xFEE8` (PGN 65256 Speed/Direction) | 100 ms | TECU | Ground/Wheel/Machine-selected speed + machine direction, J1939 format. Only when TECU enabled. |
| `0xFC8E` (Control Function Functionalities) | At claim + periodic | TECU | Announces Class 1 BasicTractorECUServer (no options). |
| NMEA2000 COG/SOG | Periodic | TECU | Optional course/speed over ground. |

The TC also receives all ISOBUS Process Data (PGN 0xCB00) and Section Control commands from connected implements.

### 5.3 What the TC handles inbound from implements

- **Device Descriptor Object Pool (DDOP)** uploads from clients (stored per client).
- **Condensed actual work-state DDIs** (160, 161, 290, plus the extended range 16001–16016 per the standard): mapped into the per-client section model and forwarded to AgIO/AgValonia as PGN `0xF0`.
- **Section control state DDI**: tracked per client.
- **Process data acknowledges (PDACK)**: logged.

### 5.4 ISOBUS feature scope

| Capability | Value |
|---|---|
| ISO 11783-10 version | 2 (Second Edition) |
| Generation | 1 (TC-SC) |
| Max booms | 1 |
| Max sections | 64 |
| Supported DDIs | 160 / 161 / 290 (condensed section setpoint and actual states), plus speed/distance/guidance DDIs from the tractor side |

### 5.5 Virtual Terminal UI

The roughly 12 KB VT object pool is embedded in the executable, so deployment does not require a separate `AOG_TC.iop` file. The committed `src/AOG_TC.iop` remains its build-time source of truth, while `src/AOG_TC.iop.h` contains the ISO-Designer-generated object IDs and authored geometry.

The pool was authored for a 480-pixel data mask and an 80-pixel softkey designator. The client asks AgIsoStack to scale both before initialization, and includes that scaling contract in the VT cache version so a terminal cannot reuse a pool cached by an older unscaled build. The UI defines five virtual navigation softkeys; terminals with fewer than five physical softkeys must support paging.

At connection, the TC logs the VT version, screen dimensions, softkey dimensions, and virtual/physical softkey counts. It warns when fewer than five virtual softkeys are available. If a VT address is detected but the client has not connected after 30 seconds, it logs the reported capabilities and recovery guidance. Clear the terminal's stored/cached object pools first when diagnosing an upload failure, because stale pools and full non-volatile pool storage can prevent an otherwise compatible upload.

## 6. Example clients

These examples talk to a TC listening on subnet `192.168.5.x`. Adjust the broadcast address to your LAN.

### 6.3 Quick command-line sanity check

```bash
# Listen for TC heartbeats with a one-liner (Linux/macOS):
nc -ul 9999 | xxd | head

# Send a subnet-detect packet with socat:
printf '\x80\x81\x7f\xc9\x05\xc9\xc9\xc0\xa8\x05\x4e' | socat - UDP-DATAGRAM:192.168.5.255:8888,broadcast
```

(The CRC byte `0x4e` is `0x7F + 0xC9 + 0x05 + 0xC9 + 0xC9 + 0xC0 + 0xA8 + 0x05` mod 256.)

---

## 7. Future direction

- The CRC verification path is in `udp_connections.cpp` but commented out. Clients are encouraged to send a correct checksum even though it is not enforced today.
- New DDIs are routinely added to PGN `0xF2`. The set in §2.5 is a snapshot — check `src/app.cpp` for the current dispatcher.
- macOS builds are not in CI yet, but the source compiles cleanly on macOS (with `CAN_DRIVER=MacCANPCAN`) and the config paths follow Apple conventions.
