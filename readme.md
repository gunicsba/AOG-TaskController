# AOG-TaskController 🚜

This is an experimental project to control sections of an ISOBUS implement using AgOpenGPS. It is based on the [AgIsoStack++](https://github.com/Open-Agriculture/AgIsoStack-plus-plus) library.

## How to run the project

After installing the desired release of AOG-TaskController, you can run it directly through AgOpenGPS itself:

1. Open AgIO.
2. Go to the `Settings` tab.
3. Click on the `ISOBUS` tab.
4. Select the CAN adapter and channel you want to use.
5. Click on the `connect` button.

## How to package the project

To package the project, you need to have the following tools installed:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM="3.16" -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -Wno-dev
cmake --build build --config Release --target package
```

The installer will be generated in the `build` directory.

## Configuration

AOG-TaskController reads its configuration from a `settings.json` file located in:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\AOG-Taskcontroller\settings.json`

One of the available options is the `tecuEnabled` flag:

- **Key:** `tecuEnabled`
- **Default:** `true`
- **Description:** Enables communication with the Tractor ECU (TECU) over ISOBUS/CAN.
- **When to disable:** Set to `false` if your tractor or simulator does not provide TECU messages, if you do not need TECU-related data, or if you are troubleshooting TECU-related issues on the CAN bus.

Example `settings.json` snippet:

```json
{
  "tecuEnabled": true
}
```

Before committing it's better to run these commands: (requires the LLVM project to be installed)
 ```powershell
git ls-files | Select-String '\.(c|cc|cpp|cxx|h|hh|hpp|hxx|proto)$' | ForEach-Object {
    clang-format -i $_.ToString()
}
```

Install cmake-format with: 
```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install cmake-format pyyaml
```
Then execute with:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter CMakeLists.txt | ForEach-Object {
    python -m cmakelang.format -i $_.FullName
}
```
